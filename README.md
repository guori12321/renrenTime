# How long have you wasted on watering Renren??

This Chrome extension aims to time how long you spend on Renren.

Basically, we want to achieve the above goal by time how long the user focuses on *renren.com* web pages.

## Current State
You can import this folder as an underdevelopping extension. And the extension will change the text `应用` on the navigation bar to how long you focuses on the \*.renren.com.\*. In fact, for the security reason, `Chrome` regards the `www.renren.com` and `share.renren.com` as different pages, so the effect of this extension is influced.

## Files List
* `content.js`: It runs everytime you open an `*.renren.com` web pages.
* `manifest.json`: The configure file of this extension.
* `README.md`: You can guess it~
* `timerDemo.html`: An html/js timer demo to help us develop this extension.
